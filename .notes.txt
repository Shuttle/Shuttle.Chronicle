- raw event store 
	- pluggable loss mitigation strategy
		* could be cross-machine caching, for instance
		* clustering
		* default sends new items to clusters immediately (zmq)
	- organizer -> may be multiple files
	- has journal | uncompressed 
	- compressed
- indexed event store 
	- organizer -> probably multiple files
	- effectively a projection of the raw events tor --- can be rebuilt from raw storage
	- dynamic page size
		* blocks of X*instance size, e.g. per stream identifier (aggregate id in case of event storage)
		* appended at back
		* index allocation table kept separately (index-file.iat.cdf) keeps track of position in file and empty spaces
		* can be shrunk to remove unallocated areas
- locking strategy
	- cannot read from indexer when writing
